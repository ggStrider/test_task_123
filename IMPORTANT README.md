This project is overengineered and I know it.
However, I was asked to show my knowledge during the interview, 
so I wrote the architecture for this project using most of my knowledge.
For a project like this, there is NO POINT in writing such a complex and extensible architecture
and using these abstractions - I KNOW IT, I UNDERSTAND IT,
so when reviewing this project, keep this point in mind
